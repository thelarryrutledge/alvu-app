# Alvu PWA Budget App - Project Memory

## Project Overview

Alvu is a Progressive Web Application for envelope-based budget management. The app enables users to manage multiple income sources, organize spending into categorized envelopes, and track financial goals through savings and debt management.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte with Vite build system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time features)
- **Deployment**: Vercel hosting platform with production domain at alvu.app
- **PWA**: Service worker and manifest for mobile installation

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Data Model Structure

- **Users**: Authentication and profile management via Supabase Auth
- **Income Sources**: Multiple streams with configurable frequencies (weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, custom)
- **Categories**: Three default categories (Unassigned, Savings, Debt) plus user-defined custom categories
- **Envelopes**: Three types - Regular (basic budgeting), Savings (goal-oriented with progress tracking), Debt (balance tracking with APR calculations)
- **Transactions**: Four types - Income (adds to available funds), Expense (deducts from envelope), Transfer (moves between envelopes), Allocation (distributes from available to envelopes)

### Key Business Logic

- **Income Processing**: Income transactions add to "Available" bucket, then user can allocate to envelopes via dynamic interface
- **Envelope Assignment**: Savings envelopes auto-assign to Savings category, Debt envelopes to Debt category, others to Unassigned unless specified
- **Manual Allocation**: Current implementation uses manual allocation interface; automation planned for future
- **Balance Management**: Real-time balance updates across all components

### User Experience Design

- **Mobile-First**: PWA optimized for mobile devices with home screen installation
- **Responsive**: Tailwind CSS ensures functionality across all screen sizes
- **Manual Entry Focus**: All transactions manually entered (no bank sync for MVP)
- **Quick Action Dashboard**: Prominent buttons for Add Income, Add Expense, Transfer Funds, Allocate Funds
- **Dynamic Interface**: Real-time allocation interface with add/remove rows and live balance updates
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators for savings goals and debt paydown

## Development Approach

- **Task-Based Development**: Single subtask implementation with testing and validation
- **Incremental Building**: 20 major tasks broken into granular subtasks
- **Quality Assurance**: Each task includes testing, documentation, and git commits
- **Security Focus**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies, input validation, and data protection
