# Alvu PWA Budget App - Project Memory

## Project Overview

Alvu is a Progressive Web Application for envelope-based budget management built with Svelte, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, and deployed on Vercel.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte with Vite, Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, authentication, real-time features)
- **Deployment**: Vercel hosting with PWA configuration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS) policies

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Data Model Structure
- **Users**: Supabase Auth with profile extensions
- **Income Sources**: Multiple streams with frequency enum (weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, custom)
- **Categories**: Three default categories (Unassigned, Savings, Debt) plus user-defined custom categories
- **Envelopes**: Three types - Regular (basic budgeting), Savings (goal-oriented), Debt (balance tracking with APR)
- **Transactions**: Four types - Income, Expense, Transfer, Allocation
- **Allocations**: Income distribution rules (manual for MVP, automation planned)
- **Payees**: Saved payee information with smart defaults

### Key Business Logic
- **Income Processing**: Income adds to "Available" bucket, then user allocates to envelopes
- **Envelope Assignment**: Auto-assignment by type (Savings→Savings category, Debt→Debt category, others→Unassigned)
- **Manual Allocation**: Current implementation uses manual allocation interface
- **Balance Management**: Real-time balance updates across all components

### Security & Data Integrity
- **Row Level Security**: All tables implement RLS policies with user_id filtering
- **Database Constraints**: Foreign key relationships with appropriate CASCADE/RESTRICT rules
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on both client and server side
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with PKCE flow and session management

## Development Approach

- **Task-Based Development**: Single subtask implementation with testing and validation
- **Quality Assurance**: Each task includes testing, documentation, and git commits
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable components with TypeScript support
- **State Management**: Svelte stores for auth, modal, and toast systems
