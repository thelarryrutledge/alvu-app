# Alvu PWA Budget App - Project Memory

## Project Overview

Alvu is a Progressive Web Application for envelope-based budget management. The app enables users to manage multiple income sources, organize spending into categorized envelopes, and track financial goals through savings and debt management.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte with Vite build system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time features)
- **Deployment**: Vercel hosting platform with production domain at alvu.app
- **PWA**: Service worker and manifest for mobile installation

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Data Model Structure

- **Users**: Authentication and profile management via Supabase Auth
- **Income Sources**: Multiple streams with configurable frequencies (weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, custom)
- **Categories**: Three default categories (Unassigned, Savings, Debt) plus user-defined custom categories
- **Envelopes**: Three types - Regular (basic budgeting), Savings (goal-oriented with progress tracking), Debt (balance tracking with APR calculations)
- **Transactions**: Four types - Income (adds to available funds), Expense (deducts from envelope), Transfer (moves between envelopes), Allocation (distributes from available to envelopes)

### Key Business Logic

- **Income Processing**: Income transactions add to "Available" bucket, then user can allocate to envelopes via dynamic interface
- **Envelope Assignment**: Savings envelopes auto-assign to Savings category, Debt envelopes to Debt category, others to Unassigned unless specified
- **Manual Allocation**: Current implementation uses manual allocation interface; automation planned for future
- **Balance Management**: Real-time balance updates across all components

### User Experience Design

- **Mobile-First**: PWA optimized for mobile devices with home screen installation
- **Responsive**: Tailwind CSS ensures functionality across all screen sizes
- **Manual Entry Focus**: All transactions manually entered (no bank sync for MVP)
- **Quick Action Dashboard**: Prominent buttons for Add Income, Add Expense, Transfer Funds, Allocate Funds
- **Dynamic Interface**: Real-time allocation interface with add/remove rows and live balance updates
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators for savings goals and debt paydown

## Development Approach

- **Task-Based Development**: Single subtask implementation with testing and validation
- **Incremental Building**: 20 major tasks broken into granular subtasks
- **Quality Assurance**: Each task includes testing, documentation, and git commits
- **Security Focus**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies, input validation, and data protection

## Critical Implementation Notes

- **Database Security**: All tables must implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- **Real-Time Updates**: Leverage Supabase real-time features for balance updates
- **PWA Requirements**: Must be installable on mobile devices and work offline
- **Responsive Design**: Must function seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- **Financial Data Integrity**: All monetary calculations must be precise and validated

## Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

- **Automation System**: Automatic allocation rules based on percentages or fixed amounts
- **Recurring Transactions**: Scheduled recurring income and expenses
- **Advanced Features**: Bank API integration, shared budgets
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Budget vs actual analysis, spending pattern insights
- **Data Export**: CSV/PDF export capabilities for transaction history
- **Performance**: Virtual scrolling for large transaction lists, efficient state management

## MVP Constraints

- **Manual Entry Only**: No bank account synchronization or automatic transaction importing
- **No Multi-Currency**: Single currency support for initial release
- **Basic Reporting**: Transaction history and filtering, advanced analytics post-MVP

## Development Guidelines

- Follow task-based development approach from guideline.md
- Implement one subtask at a time with proper testing
- Update memory.md after significant architectural decisions
- Commit changes with descriptive messages after each completed subtask
- Maintain focus on security and data integrity for financial application
